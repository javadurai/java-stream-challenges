Here are some common Java data structure challenges, along with explanations of the expected results:

1. Reversing a Linked List

Challenge: Reverse a singly linked list.

Example Input:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null

Expected Output:

4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null

Approach:

Use three pointers (prev, current, next).

Traverse the list while reversing the links.



---

2. Find the Kth Largest Element in an Array

Challenge: Given an array of integers, find the kth largest element.

Example Input:

Array = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2

Expected Output:

5

Approach:

Use a min-heap or sort the array and access the (n - k) index.

If using a heap, keep the size of the heap as k.



---

3. Validate a Binary Search Tree (BST)

Challenge: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree.

Example Input:

2
   / \
  1   3

Expected Output:

true

Example Input 2:

5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Expected Output:

false

Approach:

Use in-order traversal and check if the previous value is always less than the current value.



---

4. Finding the Middle of a Linked List

Challenge: Given a singly linked list, return the middle node.

Example Input:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

Expected Output:

3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

Approach:

Use two pointers (slow and fast). The fast pointer moves two steps while the slow pointer moves one step. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.



---

5. Finding Duplicates in an Array

Challenge: Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Example Input:

[1, 2, 3, 1]

Expected Output:

true

Approach:

Use a HashSet to track elements that have already been seen. If you find an element that’s already in the set, return true.



---

6. Two Sum Problem

Challenge: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

Example Input:

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Expected Output:

[0, 1]

Approach:

Use a HashMap to store each element’s index. For each element, check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the map.



---

7. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Challenge: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array.

Example Input:

nums1 = [1, 2, 3], nums2 = [2, 5, 6]

Expected Output:

[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Approach:

Use two pointers to traverse both arrays and add the smaller element to the result.



---

8. Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree

Challenge: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes.

Example Input:

6
   / \
  2   8
 / \ / \
0  4 7  9
   / \
  3   5

For nodes 2 and 8, the LCA is 6.

Expected Output:

6

Approach:

Traverse the tree starting from the root. If both nodes are smaller than the root, go left; if both are larger, go right. If one node is on the left and the other on the right, the current node is the LCA.



---

9. Check for Balanced Parentheses

Challenge: Given a string containing just the characters (, ), {, }, [ and ], determine if the input string is valid.

Example Input:

s = "()[]{}"

Expected Output:

true

Example Input 2:

s = "([)]"

Expected Output:

false

Approach:

Use a stack. Push opening brackets onto the stack, and for every closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack.



---

10. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array

Challenge: Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Example Input:

nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

Expected Output:

Length = 5, Array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Approach:

Use two pointers to track the current position and the next distinct element to be placed.



---

Each of these challenges involves the use of common data structures in Java, such as arrays, linked lists, binary trees, heaps, and hash maps, to achieve the desired result.

Certainly! Here are 10 tougher Java data structure challenges that delve into more advanced concepts. Each challenge includes a description, example input and expected output, along with a high-level approach to solving it.


---

1. Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache

Challenge: Design and implement a data structure for an LRU cache. It should support the following operations in O(1) time:

get(key): Retrieve the value of the key if it exists in the cache.

put(key, value): Insert or update the value of the key. If the cache exceeds its capacity, remove the least recently used item.


Example Input:

LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(2);
cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4

Expected Output:

1
-1
-1
3
4

Approach:

Utilize a combination of a HashMap for O(1) access and a Doubly Linked List to track the usage order.

When a key is accessed or inserted, move it to the front of the linked list.

When capacity is exceeded, remove the node at the end of the linked list.



---

2. Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree

Challenge: Implement serialization and deserialization of a binary tree. Serialization converts the tree to a string, and deserialization converts the string back to the original tree structure.

Example Input:

TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(5);

String serialized = serialize(root);
TreeNode deserializedRoot = deserialize(serialized);

Expected Output:

Serialized Tree: "1,2,null,null,3,4,null,null,5,null,null"

(Note: The exact serialization format may vary, e.g., using pre-order traversal with markers for nulls.)

Approach:

Use Pre-order Traversal with markers (like "null") to represent absent children.

For deserialization, recursively rebuild the tree by reading the serialized string tokens.



---

3. Implement a Trie (Prefix Tree)

Challenge: Design and implement a Trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

Example Input:

Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // returns true
trie.search("app");     // returns false
trie.startsWith("app"); // returns true
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // returns true

Expected Output:

true
false
true
true

Approach:

Each Trie node contains an array (or map) of child nodes and a boolean indicating if it’s the end of a word.

Insert words by traversing/creating nodes for each character.

Search and startsWith traverse the Trie accordingly.



---

4. Find All Anagrams in a String

Challenge: Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all start indices of p's anagrams in s. The output should be sorted in ascending order.

Example Input:

s: "cbaebabacd"
p: "abc"

Expected Output:

[0, 6]

(Explanation: The substrings "cba" (index 0) and "bac" (index 6) are anagrams of "abc".)

Approach:

Use a Sliding Window approach with character count arrays or hash maps.

Compare the counts of the current window with the counts of p to identify anagrams.



---

5. Implement a Skip List

Challenge: Design and implement a Skip List data structure with insert, delete, and search operations. The operations should have average O(log n) time complexity.

Example Input:

SkipList skipList = new SkipList();
skipList.insert(1);
skipList.insert(3);
skipList.insert(2);
skipList.search(3);    // returns true
skipList.delete(3);
skipList.search(3);    // returns false

Expected Output:

true
false

Approach:

Implement multiple levels of linked lists with probabilistic balancing.

Use randomization to decide the level of each new node.

Traverse from the top level to perform operations efficiently.



---

6. Design a Median Finder

Challenge: Create a data structure that supports adding numbers and finding the median in O(log n) time for adding and O(1) time for finding the median.

Example Input:

MedianFinder mf = new MedianFinder();
mf.addNum(1);
mf.addNum(2);
mf.findMedian();    // returns 1.5
mf.addNum(3);
mf.findMedian();    // returns 2

Expected Output:

1.5
2

Approach:

Use two Heaps: a max heap for the lower half and a min heap for the upper half of the numbers.

Balance the heaps to ensure their sizes differ by at most one.

The median is either the top of one heap or the average of the tops of both heaps.



---

7. Implement a Disjoint Set (Union-Find) with Path Compression and Union by Rank

Challenge: Create a Disjoint Set data structure that efficiently supports find and union operations with optimizations like path compression and union by rank.

Example Input:

DisjointSet ds = new DisjointSet(5); // 0 to 4
ds.union(0, 1);
ds.union(1, 2);
ds.find(0); // returns 2 (assuming path compression)
ds.find(3); // returns 3
ds.union(3, 4);
ds.find(4); // returns 3

Expected Output:

2
3
3

Approach:

Maintain an array for parent pointers and another for ranks.

find operation recursively finds the root and compresses the path.

union merges two sets by attaching the tree with lower rank to the one with higher rank.



---

8. Implement a Segment Tree for Range Sum Queries

Challenge: Build a Segment Tree to efficiently perform range sum queries and updates on an array.

Example Input:

int[] nums = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};
SegmentTree st = new SegmentTree(nums);
st.rangeSum(1, 3); // returns 15 (3 + 5 + 7)
st.update(1, 10);   // nums becomes {1, 10, 5, 7, 9, 11}
st.rangeSum(1, 3); // returns 22 (10 + 5 + 7)

Expected Output:

15
22

Approach:

Build a binary tree where each node represents the sum of a range of the array.

For updates, modify the relevant leaf and update ancestor nodes.

For range sums, traverse the tree to compute the sum efficiently.



---

9. Implement a Persistent Binary Search Tree

Challenge: Create a Persistent BST where each modification (insert/delete) creates a new version of the tree without altering the previous versions. This allows access to any historical version of the tree.

Example Input:

PersistentBST bst = new PersistentBST();
int version1 = bst.insert(5);
int version2 = bst.insert(version1, 3);
int version3 = bst.insert(version2, 7);
bst.delete(version3, 3);
TreeNode current = bst.getVersion(version4);

Expected Output:

Version 1: [5]
Version 2: [3, 5]
Version 3: [3, 5, 7]
Version 4: [5, 7]

Approach:

Implement the BST using immutable nodes where modifications create new nodes along the path from the root to the modified node.

Store references to different root nodes representing each version.

Ensure that unchanged parts of the tree are shared between versions to optimize space.



---

10. Solve the Word Ladder Problem Using BFS

Challenge: Given two words (beginWord and endWord) and a dictionary, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the dictionary.

Example Input:

beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Expected Output:

5

(Explanation: One shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which is 5 words long.)

Approach:

Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible one-letter transformations.

Use a HashSet to store the dictionary for O(1) lookups.

Track the number of transformations (levels in BFS) until the endWord is found.
