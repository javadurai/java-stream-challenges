Here are some common Java data structure challenges, along with explanations of the expected results:

1. Reversing a Linked List

Challenge: Reverse a singly linked list.

Example Input:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null

Expected Output:

4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null

Approach:

Use three pointers (prev, current, next).

Traverse the list while reversing the links.

2. Find the Kth Largest Element in an Array

Challenge: Given an array of integers, find the kth largest element.

Example Input:

Array = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2

Expected Output:

5

Approach:

Use a min-heap or sort the array and access the (n - k) index.

If using a heap, keep the size of the heap as k.

3. Validate a Binary Search Tree (BST)

Challenge: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree.

Example Input:

2
   / \
  1   3

Expected Output:

true

Example Input 2:

5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Expected Output:

false

Approach:

Use in-order traversal and check if the previous value is always less than the current value.



---

4. Finding the Middle of a Linked List

Challenge: Given a singly linked list, return the middle node.

Example Input:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

Expected Output:

3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

Approach:

Use two pointers (slow and fast). The fast pointer moves two steps while the slow pointer moves one step. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.



---

5. Finding Duplicates in an Array

Challenge: Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Example Input:

[1, 2, 3, 1]

Expected Output:

true

Approach:

Use a HashSet to track elements that have already been seen. If you find an element that’s already in the set, return true.



---

6. Two Sum Problem

Challenge: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

Example Input:

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Expected Output:

[0, 1]

Approach:

Use a HashMap to store each element’s index. For each element, check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the map.



---

7. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Challenge: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array.

Example Input:

nums1 = [1, 2, 3], nums2 = [2, 5, 6]

Expected Output:

[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Approach:

Use two pointers to traverse both arrays and add the smaller element to the result.



---

8. Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree

Challenge: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes.

Example Input:

6
   / \
  2   8
 / \ / \
0  4 7  9
   / \
  3   5

For nodes 2 and 8, the LCA is 6.

Expected Output:

6

Approach:

Traverse the tree starting from the root. If both nodes are smaller than the root, go left; if both are larger, go right. If one node is on the left and the other on the right, the current node is the LCA.



---

9. Check for Balanced Parentheses

Challenge: Given a string containing just the characters (, ), {, }, [ and ], determine if the input string is valid.

Example Input:

s = "()[]{}"

Expected Output:

true

Example Input 2:

s = "([)]"

Expected Output:

false

Approach:

Use a stack. Push opening brackets onto the stack, and for every closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack.



---

10. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array

Challenge: Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Example Input:

nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

Expected Output:

Length = 5, Array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Approach:

Use two pointers to track the current position and the next distinct element to be placed.



---

Each of these challenges involves the use of common data structures in Java, such as arrays, linked lists, binary trees, heaps, and hash maps, to achieve the desired result.
